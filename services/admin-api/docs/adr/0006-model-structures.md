## Status

Status: Accepted on 2022-10-13  
Previous status: Proposed on 2022-10-13  

## Context

In order for this service to work with different types of resources, such as users and blogs, we need to unify the models.

## Decision

Separate models folder to store all the models.

## Consequences

Resources and API endpoints are not synchronized. In order to see all the resources, multiple folders must be accessed.
